🚀 DevTracker

Track what you actually build. Not what you promise.

DevTracker is an intelligent productivity and skill-tracking prototype designed for students and developers.
Unlike traditional to-do apps that rely on manual checklists, DevTracker focuses on action-based progress, visual intelligence, and accountability-driven workflows.

🧠 Problem Statement

	Most productivity tools fail because they:

	Depend on manual task completion

	Cannot distinguish real learning from distractions

	Offer no meaningful accountability or progress insight

	Feel static and disconnected from actual effort

	As a result, users appear productive without building real skills.

💡 Solution Overview

	DevTracker reimagines task tracking by:

	Organizing work into projects and groups

	Visually simulating auto-progress and verification

	Providing live dashboards instead of static lists

	Encouraging consistency through group-based accountability
